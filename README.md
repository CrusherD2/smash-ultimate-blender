# smash-ultimate-blender
Blender Plugin that (will eventually contatin) utilities for Smash Ultimate Models and Animations.

# Current Features
1.  Creates the .NUSKTB and .NUHLPB needed for real-time animation retargeting on custom models.

# Planned Features
1. Import - Export of Models, Materials, Animations
2. Helper Bone visualization
3. Swing Bone visualization

# Dependencies
ssbh_lib_json.exe is currently needed to convert the outputted .JSON https://github.com/ultimate-research/ssbh_lib
Eventually, ssbh_lib will be called directly without needing the user to convert exported JSON

# Please Note!
This is not the model.numdlb importer script! 
# Special Thanks
SMG for creating SSBH_DATA_PY, which without it none of this would be possible https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/ssbh_data_py
(and also for providing alot of the reference code for how to use the library, most of which was shamelessly stolen and implemented here)
